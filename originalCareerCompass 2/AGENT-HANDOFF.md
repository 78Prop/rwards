# Agent Handoff Notes - August 7, 2025

## Recently Completed Setup
1. Database Migration & Schema Setup
   - Converted from PostgreSQL to SQLite using better-sqlite3
   - Created full SQLite schema with following tables:
     - `users`: Admin/user management
     - `mining_rigs`: Mining hardware tracking
     - `pool_connections`: Pool integration status
     - `miner_balances`: Balance tracking per rig
     - `mining_rewards`: Mining rewards history
     - `withdrawals`: Withdrawal tracking and processing

2. Initial Data Population
   - Created admin user (ID: 9e5499b4-f78d-41df-92c1-40a509402a2d)
   - Added sample mining rigs for test pools:
     - kloudBugsCafe
     - teraSocialJustice
     - teraToken
   - Each rig initialized with basic stats (shares, hash rates)

3. Withdrawal System Implementation
   - BlockCypher integration set up with API token
   - Hourly automatic withdrawals for balances above 0.001 BTC
   - Withdrawal tracking with transaction history
   - React-based wallet page with:
     - Balance display (confirmed/pending)
     - Manual withdrawal form
     - Transaction history
     - Real-time updates

4. Technical Implementation
   - Using Drizzle ORM for database operations
   - All tables support SQLite-specific data types
   - Foreign key constraints enabled
   - Timestamps stored as UNIX timestamps (integers)
   - React frontend for wallet interface
   - BlockCypher API for Bitcoin transactions

## Current State
- Database successfully initialized
- Schema migrations working
- Basic data structures in place
- Admin user ready for testing
- Withdrawal system operational with hourly processing
- Frontend wallet page implemented

## Next Steps
1. Additional Database Integration:
   - Analyze schema compatibility
   - Plan data migration strategy
   - Set up synchronization
   - Test data consistency

2. Monitoring & Maintenance:
   - Monitor withdrawal processing
   - Set up error alerting
   - Track failed transactions
   - Regular balance reconciliation

3. Security Enhancements:
   - Add 2FA for large withdrawals
   - Implement withdrawal limits
   - Set up admin approval workflow
   - Add audit logging

## Technical Notes
- Current database file: `mining.db`
- Schema location: `db/schema.ts`
- Migration files in: `db/migrations/`
- Init script: `db/init.ts`
- Wallet UI in: `components/WalletPage.tsx`
- Withdrawal service in: `services/withdrawal.ts`
- Hourly processor in: `services/withdrawal-processor.ts`

## Dependencies
- better-sqlite3
- drizzle-orm
- typescript (ES2022)
- uuid for ID generation
- react and react-bootstrap for UI
- blockcypher for BTC transactions

## Environment Variables Required:
- `BLOCKCYPHER_TOKEN`: API token for BlockCypher
- `HOT_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Hot wallet for processing withdrawals
- `BTC_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for hot wallet
- `MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL`: Minimum withdrawal amount (default: 0.001 BTC)

## Environment
- Database Type: SQLite
- ORM: Drizzle
- Runtime: Node.js with TypeScript
- Frontend: React with Bootstrap

## Known Issues & Workarounds
1. If balance not showing:
   - Check BlockCypher API status
   - Verify hot wallet setup
   - Check database connection
   - Monitor transaction logs

2. For failed withdrawals:
   - Review error logs
   - Check BlockCypher balance
   - Verify transaction parameters
   - Manual re-processing available through admin panel
